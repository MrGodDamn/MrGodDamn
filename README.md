- I’m just a man named Mr.God Damn that has put his life on the line, been hurt and will always help any Innocent person or animal being abused or victimized by whatever means. 
-  I’m interested in building a computer that is incapable of connecting to the internet in anyway.  For personal purposes and health issues before the Artist in me disappears that can run DAW's, make personal private Documents and edit personally made Audio and Video recorded by me without the "entire world and powers that be, stalkers if you ask me archiving my data and timing ever milli second how long it took" so when it is published there will only be a single copy burned on DVD and then uploaded or given to whomever.   I'm sick of updates changing my pc or laptop without my permission. 
-   I’m currently learning nothing!  I find it hard and it went from creepy to disturbing when anything I want to learn I'm being timed, monitored, by seen and unseen entities.  Being American doesn't feel as it felt 40 years ago I can't believe I Pay USD Currency to have carriers, internet providers, McAfee security, etc... copying and watching everything.  I can't even go to the library without a device to get some peace of mind and sit down with a couple of books without being sweated by the librarian to check them out.
